# LibcorHeap1i

- So to play around with this challenge,Just clone the repo ..then you can run it on a Vm or locally if you're on  linux.
- Else you can use the Dockerfile to set up a Docker instance ...
- It will be set up on port 1024
- So you can connect using nc Example:
[*] nc 127.0.0.1 1024
- The libc.py file is my exploit for the challenge
- To compile the binary: gcc -no-pie -o chall firstchallenge.c
- Enjoy :)
